Specific Tests:
  Describe the specific test you conducted
    ex: how did you test that the foo() method worked correctly?

  Initially, I placed statements behind the number of commands and command type
  cin readings then compiled and ran the program to make sure the input was being
  read correctly.

  A very large bug I encounted was with writing the display() method. This method
  kept throwing segmentation faults and not even copilot was able to figure it out.
  It was because the main method instantiates the NovelQueue with CPUJob*
  as the data type, wchich makes the Queue<DT> a Queue<CPUJob*> so if I access
  a Queue<CPUJob*>->_JobPointer is does not work. I tried derfrening the queue
  then pointing to job pointer, and literally anything else you can imagine.
  I did not want to change the core starting code of the project but this bug
  was taking hours to resolve.
