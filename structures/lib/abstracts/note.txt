When you can get around to it, start putting the abstracts for
each data structure in here.

Can also add the exceptions into the abstracts to declutter the
other headers.

Can also implement enumeration and other useful things that sridar
does in the book with his abstracts.

Overall, make them useful, maybe even inherit and rewire all the data
structures at some point as a test of self knowledge.
