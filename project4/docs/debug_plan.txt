Specific Tests:
  The first tests performmed on the program where outputing the input gathered when
  building the vector and getting the number of commands for the main loop of the
  program.
    This was completed to make sure (and was able to find a fix) bugs around how input
    is being read into the program and make sure there is a solid foundation before
    jumping into the main part of the program.

Issues and Resolutions:
  // the specfic issues(bugs) and how they were resolved.
Verification:
  // how the program was eventually verified to be working correctly.
